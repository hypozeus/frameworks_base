<p>When building mobile applications, it's vital to test them on real
devices prior to releasing them to users. This page covers what you need to know, 
including the types of devices that you can use, and how to set one up for
developing and debugging.</p>


<h2 id="devices">Available Devices</h2>
<p>Here are some options for obtaining devices capable of testing your applications.</p>


<h3 id="consumer">Consumer devices</h3>

<p>It's likely that one of your local mobile carriers offers an Android-powered device.
Any Android-powered device (even one bought from your mobile carrier) is a perfectly good
device for running and testing your own Android applications.
You can write applications using the Android SDK and then install them 
directly onto the device for testing.</p>

<p>Check with the service providers in your area to determine which Android-powered 
devices are available.</p>

<p>Be aware that consumer devices are not designed to allow system image updates by the
user. If you're interested in manually updating the device with custom system images, then
you'll need a developer device such as the <a href="#dev-phone-1">Android Dev Phone 1</a>.</p>



<h3 id="dev-phone-1">Android Dev Phone 1</h3>

<p>The Android Dev Phone 1 is a SIM-unlocked and hardware-unlocked device that
is designed for advanced developers. The device ships with a system image that
is fully compatible with Android 1.0, so you can rely on it when developing your
applications. You can use any SIM in the device and can flash custom Android
builds that will work with the unlocked bootloader. Unlike the bootloader on
retail devices, the bootloader on the Android Dev Phone 1 does not enforce
signed system images. The Android Dev Phone 1 should also appeal to developers 
who live in geographies where local mobile carriers do not currently offer Android-powered devices. </p>

<p>To purchase an Android Dev Phone 1 device, you must first register as an
Android developer on the Android Market site, if you haven't done so already.
Once you've logged into your developer account on Android Market, you can
purchase the device by following the link to "Development phones." To accommodate demand,
there is a limit of 1 device per developer account, for now.</p>

<p>The device currently costs $399 (USD) (including free shipping in the US),
and is available for purchase in 18 international markets, including the
US, UK, Germany, Japan, India, Canada, France, Taiwan, Spain, Australia,
Singapore, Switzerland, Netherlands, Austria, Sweden, Finland, Poland, and
Hungary.  We will continue to expand this program into new geographies over
time.  Check this page for updated information.</p>

<p>Android Dev Phone 1 devices are <em>not</em> intended for
non-developer end-users. Because the device can be configured with system
software not provided by or supported by Google or any other company, end-users
operate these devices at their own risk.</p>

<p>Note that your Android Dev Phone 1 will not receive automated 
over-the-air (OTA) updates for the system image. System updates must be flashed manually.
See the HTC site for a guide to <a href="http://www.htc.com/www/support/android/adp.html">Flashing 
your Android Dev Phone with a Factory System Image</a>.</p>

<p>For full device specs and more information about obtaining an Android Dev 
Phone 1 device, see the <a href="http://market.android.com/publish">Android 
Market</a> site.</p>



<h2 id="setting-up">Setting up a Device for Development</h2>

<p>With an Android-powered device, you can develop and debug your Android applications just as you
would on the emulator. There are just a few things to do before you can start.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Declare your application as "debuggable" in your Android Manifest.
    <p>In Eclipse, you can do this from the <b>Application</b> tab when viewing the Manifest
    (on the right side, set <b>Debuggable</b> to <em>true</em>). Otherwise, in the <code>AndroidManifest.xml</code>
    file, add <code>android:debuggable="true"</code> to the <code>&lt;application></code> element.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Turn on "USB Debugging" on your device.
    <p>On the device, go to the home screen, press <b>MENU</b>, select <b>Applications</b> > <b>Development</b>,
    then enable <b>USB debugging</b>.</p>

  </li>
  <li>Setup your system to detect your device.
    <ul>
      <li>If you're developing on Windows, you need to install a USB driver for adb. 
        Follow the steps below for <a href="#WinUsbDriver">Installing the WinUsb Driver</a>.</li>
      <li>If you're developing on Mac OS X, it just works. Skip this step.</li>
      <li>If you're developing on Ubuntu Linux, you need to add a rules file:
        <ol>
          <li>Login as root and create this file: <code>/etc/udev/rules.d/51-android.rules</code>.
            <p>For Gusty/Hardy, edit the file to read: <br/>
              <code>SUBSYSTEM=="usb", SYSFS{idVendor}=="0bb4", MODE="0666"</code></p>

            <p>For Dapper, edit the file to read: <br/>
              <code>SUBSYSTEM=="usb_device", SYSFS{idVendor}=="0bb4", MODE="0666"</code></p>
          </li>
          <li>Now execute:<br/>
              <code>chmod a+rx /etc/udev/rules.d/51-android.rules</code>
          </li>
        </ol>

      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>You can verify that your device is connected by executing <code>adb devices</code> from your 
SDK tools/ directory. If connected, you'll see the device name listed as a "device."</p>
<p>If using Eclipse, select run or debug as usual. You will be presented
with a <b>Device Chooser</b> dialog that lists the available emulator(s) and connected device(s).
Select the device to install and run the application there.</p>

<p>If using the <a href="{@docRoot}guide/developing/tools/adb.html">Android Debug Bridge</a> (adb), 
you can issue commands with the <code>-d</code> flag to target your connected device.</p>




<h2 id="WinUsbDriver">Installing the WinUsb Driver</h2>

<p>A WinUsb-based driver is needed in order to use your Android-powered device for development on a Windows machine.
The USB installation package can be found in the <code><em>&lt;sdk></em>\usb_driver\</code> 
folder of your SDK package.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If you are connecting an Android-powered device to your computer
for the first time, folllow the procedure to "Perform a fresh installation."
Android SDKs older than version 1.6 included a non-WinUsb-based driver
for connecting your device. If you installed the older USB driver and it is working properly,
you do not need to upgrade to the new driver. However, if you are having problems with the driver or 
would simply like to upgrade to the latest version, follow the procedure to "Upgrade an existing
driver." </p>

<p>Before you begin installing or upgrading the USB driver, you must
copy the USB installation package to a secure location on your computer.
For example, you might want to create a directory at <code>C:\Android\Windows\USB\install\</code> and
move it there. Once you've moved the installation package, select the appropriate procedure below, 
based on your operating system and whether you're installing for the first time or upgrading.</p>

</ol>


<p class="caution"><strong>Caution:</strong>
You may make changes to <code>android_winusb.inf</code> file found inside <code>usb_driver\</code>
(e.g., to add support for new devices), 
however, this will lead to security warnings when you install or upgrade the
driver. Making any other changes to the driver files may break the installation process.</p>
