<p>If you've just downloaded the SDK, then continue with  
<a href="{@docRoot}sdk/{@sdkCurrent}/installing.html">Installing the Android SDK</a>.</p>

<p>If you're upgrading from a previously installed version, then refer to the 
<a href="{@docRoot}sdk/{@sdkCurrent}/upgrading.html">Upgrading</a> guide.</p>

<p>Once you've completed the SDK installation, you can start learning about
development on the Android framework by reading the <a
href="{@docRoot}guide/index.html">Developer's Guide</a>. The SDK package
also includes a wide variety of code samples specific to each Android
platform. You can find the samples at this location: </p>

<p>Please note that you are currently viewing a local, offline version of the
Android developer documentation. The offline documentation offers the same
content and features as the online documentation, but since the search
capability is network-based, it will not work while you are offline.
Autocompletion for API packages and classes, also offered from the search box,
is available both online and offline and loads the reference documentation for
the item you select.</p>
