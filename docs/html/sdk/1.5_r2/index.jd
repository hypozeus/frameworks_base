<p>For more information on this SDK release, read the
<a href="{@docRoot}sdk/RELEASENOTES.html#1.5_r2">Release Notes</a>.</p>

<h2>SDK Contents</h2>

<h4>Development tools</h4>

<p>The SDK includes a full set of tools for developing and debugging application code and designing an application UI. You can read about the tools in the  
<a href="{@docRoot}guide/developing/tools/index.html">Dev Guide</a> and access them in the <code>&lt;sdk&gt;/tools/</code> directory. 

<p>The tools package in this SDK includes updates from those provided in the previous SDK. The tools also require a different project structure. To use the new tools, you need to migrate your applications to the new development environment. For more information about how to migrate, see <a href="{@docRoot}sdk/1.5_r2/upgrading.html">Upgrading the SDK</a>.

<p>For more information about the new tools features, see the <a href="{@docRoot}sdk/RELEASENOTES.html">SDK Release Notes</a>. 

<h4 id="system_images">Android Platforms</h4>

<p>This SDK includes multiple Android platform versions that you use to develop applications. For each version, both a fully compliant Android library and system image are provided. The table below lists the platform versions included in this SDK. For more information about a platform version &mdash; features, applications included, localizations, API changes, and so on &mdash; see its Version Notes. </p>

<h4 id="system_images">SDK Add-Ons</h4>

<p>An SDK add-on provides a development environment for an Android external library or a customized (but fully compliant) Android system image. This SDK includes the SDK add-on listed below. The Android system API Level required by the add-on is noted.</p>

<h4>Sample Code and Applications</h4>

<p>You can look at a variety of tutorials and samples in the <a href="{@docRoot}guide/samples/index.html">Dev Guide</a> and access the sample code itself
in the <code>&lt;sdk&gt;/platforms/android-1.5/samples/</code> directory of the SDK package. Note the new location &mdash; the SDK now includes multiple platform versions that you can develop against and each has its own sample code directory. </p>

<h4>Documentation</h4>

<p>The SDK package includes a full set of local documentation. To view it, open the <code>&lt;sdk&gt;/documentation.html</code> file in a web browser. If you are developing in an IDE such as Eclipse, you can also view the reference documentation directly in the IDE. </p>

<p>The most current documentation is always available on the Android Developers site:</p>
