<h2>Installing the SDK</h2>

	<p>After downloading the SDK, unpack the .zip archive to a suitable location on your machine. By default, the SDK files are unpacked into a directory named  <code>android_sdk_<em>&lt;platform</em>&gt;_<em>&lt;release&gt;</em>_<em>&lt;build&gt;</em></code>. The directory contains a link to a local copy of the documentation and the subdirectories <code>tools/</code>, <code>samples/</code>, and others. </p>
	
	<p>Make a note of the name and location of the unpacked SDK directory on your system &mdash; you will need to refer to the SDK directory later, when setting up the Android plugin or using SDK tools. </p>

        <p>Optionally, you can add the path to the SDK <code>tools</code> directory to your path. As mentioned above, the <code>tools/</code> directory is located in the SDK directory. </p>
     <ul>
          <li>On Linux, edit your ~/.bash_profile or ~/.bashrc file. Look
          for a line that sets the PATH environment variable and add the
          full path to the <code>tools/</code> directory to it. If you don't 
          see a line setting the path, you can add one:</li>

          <ul><code>export PATH=${PATH}:<em>&lt;your_sdk_dir&gt;</em>/tools</code></ul>

          <li>On a Mac, look in your home directory for .bash_profile and
          proceed as for Linux. You can create the .bash_profile, if 
          you haven't already set one up on your machine. </li>

          <li>On Windows, right click on My Computer, and select Properties.  
        Under the Advanced tab, hit the Environment Variables button, and in the
        dialog that comes up, double-click on Path under System Variables. Add  the full path to the <code>tools/</code> directory to the path. </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Adding <code>tools</code> to your path lets you run Android Debug Bridge (adb) and the other command line <a href="{@docRoot}guide/developing/tools/index.html">tools</a> without needing to supply the full path to the tools directory. Note that, if you update your SDK, you should remember to update your PATH settings to point to the new location, if different.</p>


<p>If you will be using the Eclipse IDE as your environment for developing Android applications, continue reading the next
section in order to install the Android Development Tools plugin and setup Eclipse. If you choose not to use Eclipse, you can 
develop Android applications using other tools &mdash; read the guide to developing 
<a href="{@docRoot}guide/developing/other-ide.html">In other IDEs</a>.</p>


<h2>Setting up Eclipse</h2>

<p>First, you should install a custom plugin called Android Development Tools (ADT), which adds integrated support for Android projects and tools. The ADT plugin includes a variety of powerful extensions that make creating, running, and debugging Android applications faster and easier. Developing in ADT/Eclipse is highly recommended for Eclipse users and those new to Android.</p>

<p>To download and install the ADT plugin, follow the steps below for your respective Eclipse version. </p>

<table style="font-size:100%">
<tr><th>Eclipse 3.3 (Europa)</th><th>Eclipse 3.4 (Ganymede)</th></tr>
<tr>
<td width="45%">
<ol>
    <li>Start Eclipse, then select <strong>Help</strong> &gt; <strong>Software Updates</strong> &gt; <strong>Find
            and Install...</strong>. </li>

    <li>In the dialog that appears, select <strong>Search for new features to install</strong> and click <strong>Next</strong>. </li>
    <li>Click <strong>New Remote Site</strong>. </li>
    <li>In the resulting dialog box, enter a name for the remote site (e.g. Android Plugin) and enter this as its URL:
        <pre>https://dl-ssl.google.com/android/eclipse/</pre>
        <p>Alternatively, you can use http in the Location URL, if you are having 
         trouble with https (https is preferred for security reasons).</p>
        <pre>http://dl-ssl.google.com/android/eclipse/</pre>
        <p>Click <strong>OK</strong>.</p> </li>
    <li>You should now see the new site added to the search list (and checked).
        Click <strong>Finish</strong>. </li>
    <li>In the subsequent Search Results dialog box, select the checkbox for
    <strong>Android Plugin</strong> &gt; <strong>Developer Tools</strong>.
    This will check both features:  "Android Developer Tools", and "Android
    Editors". The Android Editors feature is optional, but recommended.  If
    you choose to install it, you need the WST plugin mentioned earlier in this
    page. Click <strong>Next</strong>. </li>
    <li>Read the license agreement and then select <strong>Accept terms of the license agreement</strong>. 
     Click <strong>Next</strong>. </li>

<p>Now, you just need to modify your Eclipse preferences to point to the Android SDK directory:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Select <strong>Window</strong> &gt; <strong>Preferences...</strong> to open the Preferences
        panel. (Mac OS X: <strong>Eclipse</strong> &gt; <strong>Preferences</strong>) </li>
    <li>Select <strong>Android</strong> from the left panel. </li>
    <li>For the SDK Location in the main panel, click <strong>Browse...</strong> and locate the SDK directory. </li>
    <li>Click <strong>Apply</strong>, then <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Done! If you haven't encountered any problems, then you're ready to begin developing Android applications.
We recommend you begin with the <a href="{@docRoot}guide/tutorials/hello-world.html">Hello World</a> tutorial,
which will teach you some basics about Android applications and how to create projects using Eclipse.</p>


<h3 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting ADT Installation</h3>
<p> 
If you are having trouble downloading the ADT plugin after following the steps above, here are some suggestions: </p>

<ul>
	<li>If Eclipse can not find the remote update site containing the ADT plugin, try changing the remote site URL to use http, rather than https. That is, set the Location for the remote site to:
        <pre>http://dl-ssl.google.com/android/eclipse/</pre></li>
	<li>If you are behind a firewall (such as a corporate firewall), make
        sure that you have properly configured your proxy settings in Eclipse.
        In Eclipse 3.3/3.4, you can configure proxy information from the main
        Eclipse menu in <strong>Window</strong> (on Mac, <strong>Eclipse</strong>) &gt; <strong>Preferences</strong> &gt; <strong>General</strong> &gt; <strong>Network Connections</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p> 
If you are still unable to use Eclipse to download the ADT plugin as a remote update site, you can download the ADT files to your local machine using a browser and the install the files in Eclipse from there:
</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="{@docRoot}sdk/adt_download.html">Download the ADT zip file</a> (do not unpack it).
<li>Follow steps 1 and 2 in the default install instructions (above).
<li>In Eclipse 3.3, click <strong>New Archive Site...</strong>. <br/>
    In Eclipse 3.4, click <strong>Add Site...</strong>, then <strong>Archive...</strong>
<li>Browse and select the downloaded the zip file.
<li>Follow the remaining procedures, above, starting from steps 5.
</ol>
<p> 
Note that to update your plugin, you will have to follow these steps again instead of the default update instructions.</p>

<p>Note that the "Android Editors" feature of ADT requires several optional 
Eclipse components (for example, WST). If you encounter an error when 
installing ADT, your Eclipse installion might not include those components. 
For information about how to quickly add the necessary components to your 
Eclipse installation, see the troubleshooting topic 
<a href="{@docRoot}guide/appendix/faq/troubleshooting.html#installeclipsecomponents">ADT Installation Error: "requires plug-in org.eclipse.wst.sse.ui"</a>.</p>

<h4>For Linux users</h4>
<p>If you encounter this error when installing the ADT Plugin for Eclipse: 
<pre>
An error occurred during provisioning.
Cannot connect to keystore.
JKS</pre>
<p>
...then your development machine lacks a suitable Java VM. Installing Sun
Java 6 will resolve this issue and you can then reinstall the ADT
Plugin.</p>

<h2>Installation Notes</h2>
<h4>Ubuntu Linux Notes</h4>
<ul>
    <li>If you need help installing and configuring Java on your
development machine, you might find these resources helpful: 
        <ul>
           <li><a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java">https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java </a></li>
           <li><a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java">https://help.ubuntu.com/community/JavaInstallation </a></li>
       </ul>
   </li>
<li>Here are the steps to install Java and Eclipse, prior to installing
the Android SDK and ADT Plugin.
<ol>
    <li>If you are running a 64-bit distribution on your development
machine, you need to install the <code>ia32-libs</code> package using
<code>apt-get:</code>:
        <pre>apt-get install ia32-libs</pre></li>
    <li>Next, install Java:
        <pre>apt-get install sun-java6-bin</pre></li>
    <li>The Ubuntu package manager does not currently offer an Eclipse 3.3
    version for download, so we recommend that you download Eclipse from
eclipse.org (<a
href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/">http://www.eclipse.org/
downloads/</a>). A Java or RCP version of Eclipse is recommended.</li>
<li>Follow the steps given in previous sections to install the SDK 
and the ADT plugin. </li>
</ol>
</ul>
<h4>Other Linux Notes</h4>
<ul>
    <li>If JDK is already installed on your development computer, please
take a moment to make sure that it meets the version requirements listed
at the top of this page. In particular, note that some Linux
distributions may include JDK 1.4 or Gnu Compiler for Java, both of
which are not supported for Android development.</li>
</ul>
