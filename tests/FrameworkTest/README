FrameworkTestApplication should hold snippets of functionality that are
helpful for testing the UI framework code, but not appropriate for
sample code.  For instance, a layout contrived to exercise an edge case
of scrolling behavior.

InstrumentationTestCases should be added under tests and added to the
list of tests in FrameworkInstrumentationTestRunner.
